                    <h2> What will you be learning?</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Basic techniques jQuery: with jQuery, you can easily manipulate the
                            content of your web pages, making it possible to create dynamic and interactive websites.
                            The implementation script is the code that includes the jQuery library and any custom
                            JavaScript code that you've written to use with it. This script is usually included in the
                            head section of your HTML file.</li><br>
                        <li>Selectors: they allow you to target specific elements on a web page based on their HTML tag,
                            class, ID, attributes, or relationships to other elements. Learning how to use selectors
                            effectively is essential to working with jQuery, as it allows you to manipulate elements
                            with precision and granularity.</li><br>
                        <li>Events: are actions or occurrences that happen in a web page, such as a user clicking on a
                            button, scrolling the page, or hovering over an image. Some common use cases for event
                            handling in jQuery include form validation, dynamic content loading, and creating
                            interactive UI elements like sliders, accordions, and tabs.</li><br>
                        <li>Effects: fade, slide, toggle, and so much more fun stuff, are used to enhance the user
                            experience on a website by making it more interactive and engaging.</li><br>
                        <li>jQuery UI: with jQuery UI, you can add a wide range of UI elements to your web pages,
                            including buttons, datepickers, sliders, accordions, and dialog boxes. These elements are
                            highly customizable, allowing you to change their appearance, behavior, and functionality to
                            suit your needs.</li><br>
                        <li>Animation with jQuery: some examples of animation effects you can create with jQuery include
                            sliding panels, fading elements in and out, rotating images, and creating custom animations
                            using keyframes. Animation with jQuery can make your web pages more visually appealing, help
                            to guide the user's attention, and create a more immersive experience. It is an essential
                            tool for modern web development and can be used to enhance user interfaces, create
                            interactive games and applications, and add visual interest to content.</li><br>
                        <li>How to select, add and configure plugins: plugins are additional sets of functionalities
                            that can be added to jQuery to make development faster and easier. In order to use a plugin,
                            you need to select it, add it to your project, and configure it to work with your code.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>JSON and AJAX: JSON can be used to communicate with web servers to retrieve or send data in
                            a structured way, without requiring a page refresh. This is accomplished using AJAX
                            (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) technology, which allows the browser to make asynchronous
                            requests to a web server and update the page content dynamically without requiring a full
                            page reload.</li><br>
                        <li>Create a custom plugin: creating a custom plugin is a powerful way to extend the
                            functionality of jQuery to meet the specific needs of your project.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div id="duration" class="ui-tabs-panel ui-widget-content ui-corner-bottom" role="tabpanel"
                    style="display: none;">
                    <h2>Duration of the course</h2>
                    <p>
                        The duration of the course will depend on the mode of learning you choose. If you opt for
                        distance learning with V-School, the course will consist of 60 lesson times, which you can
                        complete at your own pace from the comfort of your home. This flexible option allows you to
                        balance your studies with your other commitments and tailor your learning experience to your
                        individual needs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Alternatively, if you prefer a more structured and immersive learning environment, you can
                        choose to attend the Full Stack WebDeveloper program at CVO de Verdieping in person. This
                        program lasts for around 10 months and provides hands-on training with expert teachers and
                        fellow students. By working together in a collaborative setting, you'll have the opportunity to
